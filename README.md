# Olympic Data Analysis

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Olympic athlete data to understand trends in age, height, weight, gender participation, medal distribution, and country performance. The analysis uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📂 Project Files
- **Analysis.ipynb** — Complete analysis with visualizations  
- **olympic_dataset.csv** — Dataset used for the project  
- **README.md** — Project documentation  
- **requirements.txt** — Required Python libraries  

## Analysis Overview
This project includes analysis of:

- Gender distribution of athletes  
- Age distribution  
- Height and weight distribution  
- Medal distribution (Gold, Silver, Bronze)  
- Medal trends over time  
- Average age trend across years  
- Sport-wise height comparison  
- Country-wise gender statistics  
- Gold medal leaderboard  
- Number of unique events per sport  
- Participation trend over the years  
- Season-wise age distribution  
- Height distribution by medal type  
- Height vs Weight correlation (with medal status)  

## Key Insights
- Most athletes are between **20–30 years old**.  
- Athlete height generally ranges from **165–185 cm**.  
- Common weight range is **60–80 kg**.  
- The **USA** leads with the highest number of gold medals.  
- Athletics and Swimming have the most events.  
- Summer Olympics attract slightly younger athletes compared to Winter.  
- Medalists (especially Gold/Silver) show more consistent height–weight patterns.  
- Height and weight have a strong positive correlation.  
- Participation in the Olympics has increased dramatically over time.  

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights strong patterns across athlete characteristics, medal performance, and country-wise contributions. It shows how physical attributes, age, and participation trends evolve across sports, seasons, and eras. This project provides a clear
